    <h2>Basic Facts:</h2>
    <br>
    <h4 id="info">
        - Exoplanets are planets beyond our solar system. Most of them orbit other stars, while free-floating exoplanets(rogue planets) are untethered to any star.  Some look like planets in our own solar system, while others are dramatically different.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Exoplanets seem to follow the same general rules as the planets in our solar system: Small planets are rocky, big planets are gassy, and the ones in between may be watery.
        <br>
        <br>
        - The word "exoplanet" comes from the term "extrasolar planet," which means that it orbits stars other than the sun, and thus exists outside of our solar system.

    <h5>WASP-18b is an exoplanet located 325 light-years from Earth. The planet's mass is 10 times that of Jupiter, and it orbits its star once every 23 hours.</h5>

    <h2>Types:</h2>
    <br>
    <h4 id="info">
        - Rocky planets/Terrestrial planets; A rocky world outside our solar system.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Ice giants: A giant planet composed mainly of elements such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Gas giants: A giant planet composed mainly of gas.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Carbon planets: Rocky planets in carbon-rich systems. They have rocks formed of compounds of silicon and carbon, different from our solar system's silicon and oxygen rocks. 
        <br>
        <br>
        - Hot Jupiters: Jupiter-like planets that are as close or closer to their sun than the orbit of Mercury.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Hot Neptunes: Neptune-like planets that are as close or closer to their sun than the orbit of Mercury.

        - Cold Jupiters: Orbit farther out in the planetary system.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        - Lava planets: Superdense and are larger than Earth worlds. Have close and hot orbits.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Super-Earths/Super-Terrestrials: A potentially/typically rocky world, larger than Earth.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Mini-Neptunes: Gaseous worlds around the size of Neptune, or smaller than Neptune but larger than Earth.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Ocean planets(in between Super-Earths and Mini-Neptunes): Have liquid-water oceans hundreds of kilometers deep.

    <h2>Naming Exoplanets:</h2>
    <h4 id="para">
        The IAU (International Astronomical Union) is the authority responsible for naming celestial planets, including exoplanets.
      </h4>
    <br>
    <h4 id="info">
        - The first part of an exoplanet name is usually the telescope or survey that discovered it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        - The number is the order in which the star was cataloged by position. 
        <br>
        <br>
        - The lowercase letter stands for the planet, in the order in which the planet was found (the first planet is always named “b”, with ensuing planets named “c”, “d”, etc). 
        <br>
        <br>
        - The star that the exoplanet orbits is usually the undeclared "A" of the system (useful if the system contains many stars, which themselves may be designated “B” or “C”).

        <h3>TOI-715 b</h3>
        <br>
        <h4 id="typeinfo">It was first discovered in 2023. It is about 137 light-years away from our planet, and is a super-Earth that orbits a red dwarf sun. The exoplanet has a mass of 3.02 Earths and it is about one and a half times as wide as Earth. It orbits within the “conservative” habitable zone around its parent star, which is the distance from the star that could give the planet the right temperature for liquid water to form on its surface.</h4>

At the time of its discovery in 2009, it was the smallest planet known outside our solar system. It is a rocky planet. It orbits its star incredibly closely, taking only 20 hours to circle it at an altitude only about 1.5 times the diameter of the star itself.</h4>
